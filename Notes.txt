React-native-web notes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CBYbEGvxYY

yarn create react-app <appname> --typescript
- sets up typescript and a base react app
- added typescript imports to vscode
* suggested react-native 0.55.4 since that was compatible with react-native-web 
- react-native@0.55.4
- react-native-web@0.10.0
- react-art@16.8.2
* i installed latest
yarn add -D @types react-native (@0.55.4)

remove unecessary boilerplate
logo.svg
index.css
App.css
App.test.tsx
- remove reference to index.css from index.tsx

__________________________________________________________

add app registry from react-native
* set up in vscode to remove dependencies not used!
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.organizeImports": true
}
* useful user snippets in typescriptreact.json
  "Typescript React Function Component": {
    "prefix": "rh",
    "body": [
      "import * as React from 'react'",
      "",
      "interface Props {",
      "",
      "}",
      "",
      "export const $1: React.FC<Props> = () => {",
      "\t\treturn ($2);",
      "}"
    ],
    "description": "Typescript React Function Component"
  },
  "React Native StyleSheet": {
    "prefix": "rnss",
    "body": [
      "import {StyleSheet} from 'react-native'",
      "const styles = StyleSheet.create({",
      "",
      "});"
    ],
    "description": "React Native StyleSheet"
  }

add react native views to App.tsx
run `yarn start` and see it fly!
generates a LOT of classes

SHIFT to trying to run hooks in react-native
This react-native app will end up in the monorepo!

I tried to follow along stupidly in this project instead of a separate project. Here's the notes....
getting the mobile app up
expo? does not work with hooks! so we use react-native CLI

npm i -g react-native-cli
referencing https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/05/07/using-typescript-with-react-native
react-native init GunsOfSteel --template typescript
* error: --template flag not working...
works when you do it NOT in a project (duh)
Noteworthy, not used:
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript @babel/preset-env @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread

he bumps the versions in the generated project and adds ios starter script and updates to use functional component
my script ran with latest already
add ios script
ios: react-native run-ios

run yarn start and yarn ios separately, WORKS!

wants it to be a monorepo - BRILLIANT! WHO IS THIS MAN!
________________________________________________________________

Setting up the monorepo
- move things into packages/
npm init -y creates the package.json
update to private: true and workspaces: packages/*
add the app version with hooks (the file we edited) to common/index.tsx
add react, react-native as deps and add dev deps typescript, @types/react-native to common 
add tsconfig.json to common, with adjustments
make sure typescript is installed globally
npm install typescript -g
yarn build in common 

point web App to the @wow/common App you are exporting

had to drop jest version in the app because of react-scripts stupid thing.
did not have to add his addition of SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to the start script in web. it just worked.
can add rimraf dist (need the dev dep) to remake dist from scratch.


_________________________________________________________________________

settng up app in monorepo
add @wow/common dep
to deal with starting the app, don't hoise react-native under just one package
add to "workspaces" in root:
"nohoist": ["react-native", "react-native/**"]
may need to delete the generated build folder in app to get it to run
symlinks are a problem:
install a watchman type thing 
npm install -g wml
wml add ../common ./node_modules/@wow/common
wml start
had to add "react, react/**" as well to nohoist
MAYBE this can be done with lerna?

__________________________________________________________________________

mobx for data management in @wow/common
yarn add mobx-react-lite@1.0.1 mobx5.9.0
I installed latest, which was 1.1.1, 5.9.0

create CounterStore with mobx decorator
turn on experimentalDecorators in tsconfig

update to observe store in index
add tsc --watch in common to keep that going

watch it fly

WorkoutStore

add currentSquat, shows error for him. turn off "strictPropertyInitialization" in tsconfig
add the rest of the stuffs
