React-native-web notes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CBYbEGvxYY

yarn create react-app <appname> --typescript
- sets up typescript and a base react app
- added typescript imports to vscode
* suggested react-native 0.55.4 since that was compatible with react-native-web 
- react-native@0.55.4
- react-native-web@0.10.0
- react-art@16.8.2
* i installed latest
yarn add -D @types react-native (@0.55.4)

remove unecessary boilerplate
logo.svg
index.css
App.css
App.test.tsx
- remove reference to index.css from index.tsx

__________________________________________________________

add app registry from react-native
* set up in vscode to remove dependencies not used!
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.organizeImports": true
}
* useful user snippets in typescriptreact.json
  "Typescript React Function Component": {
    "prefix": "rh",
    "body": [
      "import * as React from 'react'",
      "",
      "interface Props {",
      "",
      "}",
      "",
      "export const $1: React.FC<Props> = () => {",
      "\t\treturn ($2);",
      "}"
    ],
    "description": "Typescript React Function Component"
  },
  "React Native StyleSheet": {
    "prefix": "rnss",
    "body": [
      "import {StyleSheet} from 'react-native'",
      "const styles = StyleSheet.create({",
      "",
      "});"
    ],
    "description": "React Native StyleSheet"
  }

add react native views to App.tsx
run `yarn start` and see it fly!
generates a LOT of classes

SHIFT to trying to run hooks in react-native
This react-native app will end up in the monorepo!

I tried to follow along stupidly in this project instead of a separate project. Here's the notes....
getting the mobile app up
expo? does not work with hooks! so we use react-native CLI

npm i -g react-native-cli
referencing https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/05/07/using-typescript-with-react-native
react-native init GunsOfSteel --template typescript
* error: --template flag not working...
works when you do it NOT in a project (duh)
Noteworthy, not used:
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript @babel/preset-env @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread

he bumps the versions in the generated project and adds ios starter script and updates to use functional component
my script ran with latest already
add ios script
ios: react-native run-ios

run yarn start and yarn ios separately, WORKS!

wants it to be a monorepo - BRILLIANT! WHO IS THIS MAN!
________________________________________________________________

Setting up the monorepo
- move things into packages/
npm init -y creates the package.json
update to private: true and workspaces: packages/*
add the app version with hooks (the file we edited) to common/index.tsx
add react, react-native as deps and add dev deps typescript, @types/react-native to common 
add tsconfig.json to common, with adjustments
make sure typescript is installed globally
npm install typescript -g
yarn build in common 

point web App to the @wow/common App you are exporting

had to drop jest version in the app because of react-scripts stupid thing.
did not have to add his addition of SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to the start script in web. it just worked.
can add rimraf dist (need the dev dep) to remake dist from scratch.


_________________________________________________________________________

settng up app in monorepo
add @wow/common dep
to deal with starting the app, don't hoise react-native under just one package
add to "workspaces" in root:
"nohoist": ["react-native", "react-native/**"]
may need to delete the generated build folder in app to get it to run
symlinks are a problem:
install a watchman type thing 
npm install -g wml
wml add ../common ./node_modules/@wow/common
wml start
had to add "react, react/**" as well to nohoist
MAYBE this can be done with lerna?

__________________________________________________________________________

mobx for data management in @wow/common
yarn add mobx-react-lite@1.0.1 mobx5.9.0
I installed latest, which was 1.1.1, 5.9.0

create CounterStore with mobx decorator
turn on experimentalDecorators in tsconfig

update to observe store in index
add tsc --watch in common to keep that going

watch it fly

_________________________________________________________________________
WorkoutStore

add currentSquat, shows error for him. turn off "strictPropertyInitialization" in tsconfig
add the rest of the stuffs

___________________________________________________________________
Navigation

React Navigation isn't set up great yet for web and native, so just gonna do something simple with store
Basic set up with mobx
Start basic styling of containers
He struggles to get it to 100% height... will fix next video
